Weekly Product Sync - January 15, 2024
Attendees: Sarah Chen (PM), Mike Johnson (Engineering Lead), Lisa Park (Designer), David Kim (Backend Engineer), Rachel Torres (QA Lead)

[00:00] Sarah Chen: Good morning everyone! Let's kick off our weekly product sync. We have a lot to cover today - dashboard redesign, API documentation, and the upcoming Q1 release.

[00:45] Mike Johnson: Before we start, I want to flag that we're behind on the Redis migration. We originally committed to finishing it last week but hit some unexpected issues with data serialization.

[01:30] Sarah Chen: Thanks for the heads up, Mike. Let's make that a priority discussion. But first, Lisa, can you walk us through the dashboard redesign progress?

[02:15] Lisa Park: Sure! I've completed the wireframes for the new dashboard. The main changes are a simplified navigation, dark mode support, and a new widget system. I'm proposing we go with dark mode as the default theme based on user research showing 73% of our users prefer it.

[03:45] David Kim: I like the dark mode idea, but we need to consider accessibility. Some users with visual impairments might struggle with low contrast.

[04:20] Lisa Park: Good point, David. I'll add a high-contrast mode as an option. I commit to having the updated designs with accessibility fixes ready by next Wednesday.

[05:00] Sarah Chen: Perfect. And regarding the dark mode default - I think we should proceed with that decision. Any objections? [No objections] Great, decision made: dark mode will be the default theme for the new dashboard.

[05:45] Mike Johnson: For the technical implementation, I'll need to coordinate with Lisa on the component library updates. I can own the frontend architecture changes. The action item for me is to create the theme switching infrastructure by Friday.

[06:30] Sarah Chen: Thanks Mike. Now let's discuss the API documentation issue. David, you were working on this?

[07:00] David Kim: Yes, the API docs are about 60% complete. I've documented all the authentication endpoints and user management APIs. Still need to cover the billing API and webhooks. My target is to finish the full documentation by end of next week.

[07:45] Rachel Torres: I'd like to add that we need the API docs before we can complete our integration testing. This is becoming a blocker for the QA team.

[08:15] Sarah Chen: Understood. David, can you prioritize the billing API docs since that's what Rachel's team needs first?

[08:30] David Kim: Sure, I commit to having the billing API documentation done by this Friday so Rachel's team can start testing.

[09:00] Mike Johnson: On the Redis migration - the issue is that our current data serialization format isn't compatible with Redis Cluster. I need to rewrite the serialization layer. This is going to push our timeline by at least a week.

[09:45] Sarah Chen: That's concerning. We promised stakeholders we'd have improved caching for the Q1 release. Mike, what's the earliest realistic completion date?

[10:15] Mike Johnson: If I focus on this exclusively, I can have the Redis migration complete by January 25th. But that means I'll need to hand off some of my other tasks.

[10:45] Sarah Chen: Let's do it. Who can pick up Mike's dashboard theme work?

[11:00] Lisa Park: I can handle the CSS side of the theme implementation. That's actually in my wheelhouse.

[11:15] Sarah Chen: Great! Decision: Lisa will own the theme CSS implementation, Mike will focus exclusively on Redis migration. Target date for Redis: January 25th.

[11:45] Rachel Torres: For QA, I want to confirm our testing priorities. We have the dashboard redesign, API integration tests, and performance testing for the Redis changes. What's the order?

[12:15] Sarah Chen: Let's prioritize: 1) API integration tests once David delivers the billing docs, 2) Redis performance testing after Mike's migration, 3) Dashboard redesign testing last since that's more visual.

[12:45] Mike Johnson: One more thing - I discovered that our current caching approach conflicts with the new dashboard widget system. The widgets expect real-time data, but our cache has a 5-minute TTL.

[13:15] Lisa Park: That's a problem. My designs assume the widgets update instantly. We discussed this in the design review and decided on real-time updates.

[13:45] Sarah Chen: This is a conflict we need to resolve. Mike, what are our options?

[14:00] Mike Johnson: We could either reduce the cache TTL to 30 seconds, which impacts server load, or implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates, which is more work but better long-term.

[14:30] Sarah Chen: Let's go with WebSockets. It aligns with our long-term architecture goals. Mike, add this to your backlog after Redis.

[15:00] David Kim: I can help with the WebSocket implementation. I've done this before at my previous company.

[15:15] Sarah Chen: Great, David. I'm assigning you as the secondary owner for WebSocket implementation. Target date: February 5th.

[15:45] Rachel Torres: I'll need to update our test plans to include WebSocket testing. Action item for me: create WebSocket test plan by January 30th.

[16:15] Sarah Chen: Perfect. Let's also discuss the mobile app. We've had reports that the iOS app is crashing on startup for some users.

[16:45] Mike Johnson: I looked into this yesterday. It's related to the new analytics SDK we integrated. I've pinpointed the issue - it's a memory leak in the session tracking code.

[17:15] Rachel Torres: How widespread is this crash? It wasn't in my test reports.

[17:30] Mike Johnson: It only affects users with iOS 15 on older iPhone models. About 12% of our mobile user base.

[18:00] Sarah Chen: That's significant. Mike, can you add this to your plate or should we ask someone else?

[18:15] Mike Johnson: I really can't take more on with the Redis work. We need someone else.

[18:30] Sarah Chen: David, can you investigate the iOS analytics crash? I know mobile isn't your primary area, but you've helped there before.

[18:45] David Kim: I can look at it, but I can't commit to a fix date until I understand the issue better. I'll do the investigation by tomorrow and report back.

[19:15] Sarah Chen: That works. Last topic - upcoming stakeholder demo on January 28th. We need to prepare a demo of the dashboard redesign progress.

[19:45] Lisa Park: I commit to having a clickable prototype ready by January 26th for the demo. It won't be fully functional but will showcase the new design.

[20:15] Sarah Chen: Excellent. Let me summarize the key decisions and action items:
