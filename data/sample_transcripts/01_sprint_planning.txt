Sprint Planning Meeting - January 15, 2026
Attendees: Priya Sharma (Engineering Lead), Wei Chen (Backend), Sofia Andersson (Frontend), Carlos Rodriguez (DevOps), Mike Johnson (Product Manager)

Mike Johnson: Alright team, let's kick off our Q1 sprint planning. We have three major initiatives this quarter - the real-time collaboration feature, performance optimization, and the mobile app beta.

Priya Sharma: Thanks Mike. I've been reviewing the technical requirements. Wei, you'll be leading the backend work for real-time collaboration. We need WebSocket infrastructure and conflict resolution.

Wei Chen: Understood. I've already started researching CRDT algorithms for the conflict resolution piece. I think we can have the initial WebSocket server ready by end of next week.

Sofia Andersson: For the frontend, I'll need to sync closely with Wei on the WebSocket integration. I'm planning to use a reactive state management approach to handle real-time updates smoothly.

Carlos Rodriguez: From the infrastructure side, I'll need to set up the WebSocket load balancer. Also, we should discuss the Redis cluster for pub/sub messaging.

Mike Johnson: Good point Carlos. What's the timeline for the infrastructure setup?

Carlos Rodriguez: I can have the staging environment ready by January 22nd. Production would follow a week later once we validate the scaling behavior.

Priya Sharma: That works. Let me assign the specific tasks. Wei, your action item is to implement the WebSocket server with basic connection handling by January 22nd. Sofia, you'll work on the real-time UI components, deadline is January 29th. Carlos, infrastructure setup by January 22nd as discussed.

Mike Johnson: I'll handle stakeholder communication and prepare the demo for the board meeting on February 5th. We need to show tangible progress on this feature.

Wei Chen: One concern - we'll need to coordinate with the security team about WebSocket authentication. Should I reach out to Isabella about that?

Priya Sharma: Yes, please do. Loop in Isabella Martinez from security. She needs to be aware of our WebSocket implementation for the security review.

Sofia Andersson: I have a question about the mobile app timeline. Are we still targeting March for the beta?

Mike Johnson: Yes, March 15th is the target for internal beta. Arjun Patel is leading the mobile development. He'll join us next sprint for detailed planning.

Carlos Rodriguez: I'll make sure our CI/CD pipeline supports mobile builds. That's going to require some additional configuration.

Priya Sharma: Let's capture that. Carlos, add mobile CI/CD setup to your backlog for February.

Mike Johnson: Great progress everyone. The priority order is: infrastructure, backend WebSocket, frontend integration. Any blockers we should discuss?

Wei Chen: No blockers currently, but I might need a pair programming session with Sofia once I have the API contracts ready.

Sofia Andersson: Happy to do that. Just ping me when you're ready.

Priya Sharma: Perfect. Let's reconvene on Friday for a quick sync. Meeting adjourned.
