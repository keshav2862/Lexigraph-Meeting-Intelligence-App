Quarterly Retrospective - January 31, 2026
Attendees: Priya Sharma (Engineering Lead), Wei Chen (Backend), Sofia Andersson (Frontend), Carlos Rodriguez (DevOps), Lisa Zhang (Platform), Marcus Weber (Database), Isabella Martinez (Security), Arjun Patel (Mobile)

Priya Sharma: Welcome to our Q4 retrospective. We'll cover what went well, what didn't, and improvements for Q1. Let's start with wins.

Sofia Andersson: The design system overhaul was a big win. Components are now consistent and development is faster. The team really rallied on that.

Carlos Rodriguez: Infrastructure stability improved significantly. We had 99.7% uptime in Q4 compared to 97% in Q3.

Wei Chen: The API refactoring paid off. Response times are down 30% and the codebase is much more maintainable.

Arjun Patel: Mobile app store rating went from 3.8 to 4.3 stars. User complaints about crashes dropped dramatically.

Marcus Weber: Database query optimization was a quiet win. We reduced our read replicas from 3 to 2 and still have better performance.

Priya Sharma: Great achievements everyone. Now what didn't go well?

Lisa Zhang: The database outage last week. Even though we recovered quickly, it highlighted gaps in our monitoring.

Carlos Rodriguez: Agreed. We were reactive instead of proactive. The new alerts should fix that.

Isabella Martinez: Security review cycles are too slow. Features wait 2-3 weeks for my sign-off. I'm a bottleneck.

Wei Chen: That did delay our WebSocket launch. We need a faster process.

Sofia Andersson: Cross-team communication could be better. Several times I built UI for APIs that weren't ready, causing rework.

Arjun Patel: Same issue on mobile. Better API contracts earlier would help.

Priya Sharma: Pattern I'm hearing: we need better coordination and earlier feedback loops. Improvements?

Isabella Martinez: I propose security champions. Train one person per team on security basics so they can do initial reviews. That reduces my bottleneck.

Wei Chen: I volunteer to be the backend security champion.

Carlos Rodriguez: Good idea. I'll be the infrastructure champion.

Priya Sharma: Love it. Isabella will run champion training in February.

Sofia Andersson: For cross-team coordination, can we do API contract reviews before implementation starts?

Wei Chen: Yes, let's require API specs to be approved before backend development begins. I'll add it to our definition of ready.

Arjun Patel: That would really help mobile. We could start mock implementations while backend develops.

Marcus Weber: On monitoring, I suggest we adopt SRE practices. Define SLIs and SLOs for critical services.

Carlos Rodriguez: I've read the Google SRE book. Happy to lead that initiative.

Priya Sharma: Perfect. Carlos leads SRE practices adoption in Q1.

Lisa Zhang: One more thing - documentation is scattered. Can we consolidate to a single source of truth?

Sofia Andersson: We have Notion, Confluence, and GitHub wikis. It's confusing.

Priya Sharma: Let's standardize on Notion. Mike, can you help with the migration plan?

Wei Chen: I'll start moving backend docs to Notion this month as a pilot.

Priya Sharma: Let me summarize improvements for Q1. One: security champion program led by Isabella. Two: API contract reviews before implementation. Three: SRE practices adoption led by Carlos. Four: documentation consolidation to Notion.

Marcus Weber: This is a good list. Achievable and high impact.

Arjun Patel: Agreed. Q4 was solid but Q1 will be even better with these changes.

Isabella Martinez: Thanks for the honest feedback everyone. These retrospectives are valuable.

Priya Sharma: Absolutely. Let's make Q1 our best quarter yet. Meeting adjourned.
